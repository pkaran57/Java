<!-- We mainly have 3 components to work with Log4j:

Logger: It is used to log the messages.
Appender: It is used to publish the logging information to the destination like a file, database, console etc.
Layout: It is used to format logging information in different styles.

Logging levels are divided into the following set:

Fatal: error messages that indicate that some subsystem or the entire program cannot continue execution and will terminate.
Error: error messages regarding a problem that should be handled by a human. These are generally useful for operators to alert on.
Warn: warning messages regarding potential problems that may need to be handled by a human. This level is often misused and ignored as a result.
Info: informative messages about the state of a program. These types of messages tend to be related to the lifecycle of a program and can be viewed as a way to debug the macro state of the program.
Debug: debugging information about internal states of the program. These messages are usually only helpful to the developers maintaining a program.
Trace: messages tracing the execution flow of a program. These messages are usually very low level and simply mirror the micro state of a program and generally donâ€™t offer more information than a debugger would.
-->

<!--The status logger is used internally by log4j2 components. Setting status="debug" (or "trace") in the configuration will cause this internal logging to be output to the command line.
It will print debug information about which log4j2 plugin components are loaded (all configuration elements map to log4j2 plugins), and more details like for example what appenders and
loggers were found, what parameters they have and how they are combined.-->
